==================

Virtual Class Room
This is Virtual Class Room System built using QT

Use It at your own risk.


I have used modules from different programmers and some examples/demo from QT combined them as single application and
thus do not take any credits for the work. Though I have designed the GUI and login Sytem (I am newbee to QT)
And I am Still Working on writing the complete code from scratch and implementing things my way :)
You will need VLC development Library for running this application.
